# Amazon Clone

## General Info

Small front-end amazon clone that I made around my senior year of high school. This was a huge project to me since I was first starting to learn React and the front-end.

With the help of YouTube and the internet I got my first glimpse of some of these React technologies.

- Firebase 🔥
- React Router ⚛️
- React Context API ⚛️ (no more having to drill state 😄)
